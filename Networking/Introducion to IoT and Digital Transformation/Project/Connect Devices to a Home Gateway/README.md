## IoT Devices Connected to a Local Server 

This project in **Cisco Packet Tracer** was designed to demonstrate the connection of IoT devices to a Home Gateway, allowing remote control via a local network. The setup consists of a **router** and a **home gateway** managing the IoT devices' network.

1. **Router**:
   - Configured with the default IP **192.168.0.1**, the router serves as the main connection point for devices such as tablets, smartphones, and laptops.

2. **Home Gateway**:
   - Configured with IP **192.168.0.102**, the gateway acts as an intermediary between the main network and the IoT devices.
   - The gatewayâ€™s LAN was set up with IP **192.168.2.2**, providing IP addresses to the IoT devices connected to the internal network.

3. **Connected Devices**:
   - Devices like tablets, smartphones, and laptops connect directly to the router, gaining access to the Home Gateway. This allows them to control the IoT devices remotely and efficiently.

This project demonstrates how to set up a simple network to connect and manage IoT devices using only a Home Gateway, enabling control of the devices through the internal network.
