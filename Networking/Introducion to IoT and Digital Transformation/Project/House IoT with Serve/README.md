## IoT Devices Connected to a Local Server - Project Overview

This project in **Cisco Packet Tracer** was designed to demonstrate the connection of IoT devices to a local server, allowing remote control via a local network. The setup consists of a **router**, an **IoT server**, and a **home gateway** managing the IoT devices' network.

1. **Router**:
   - Configured with the default IP **192.168.0.1**, the router serves as the main connection point for devices such as tablets, smartphones, and laptops.

2. **IoT Server**:
   - The local server was set up with the IP **192.168.0.103**.
   - The IoT service was activated on the server, enabling control of the connected devices.
   - The server login credentials are **root** as the username and **DSZ@pp27** as the password.

3. **Home Gateway**:
   - Configured with IP **192.168.0.102**, the gateway acts as an intermediary between the main network and the IoT devices.
   - The gatewayâ€™s LAN was set up with IP **192.168.2.2**, providing IP addresses to the IoT devices connected to the internal network.

4. **Connected Devices**:
   - Devices like tablets, smartphones, and laptops connect directly to the router, gaining access to the local IoT server. This allows them to control the IoT devices remotely and efficiently.

This project demonstrates how to set up a simple network to connect and manage IoT devices using a local server, enabling control of the devices through the internal network.
