# Cisco Certifications Resources and Projects

Welcome to my repository dedicated to my Cisco certification journey.

## About

This repository contains **study resources** and **hands-on projects** I am developing while preparing for various Cisco certifications, including but not limited to:

- CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)
- CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional)
- Other relevant Cisco certifications

## Contents

Here you will find:

- **Practical labs** built using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and/or real networking environments
- **Simulated network topologies** with router, switch, VLAN, NAT, DHCP, and ACL configurations
- **Study notes**, useful commands, and topic summaries
- **Configuration scripts** and `.pkt` files for the projects
- **References and links** to official and community learning resources

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to consolidate my learning through practice and to help others who are also studying for Cisco certifications. All content is based on official exam topics and real-world scenarios.

## Disclaimer

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated continuously as I progress in my studies. Feel free to follow along, suggest improvements, or contribute with your ideas.
